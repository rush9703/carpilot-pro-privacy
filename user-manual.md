### Mounting Your Phone
For accurate data, your iPhone must be securely mounted in the vehicle.
1.  **Secure Mount**: Use a sturdy phone holder. Avoid loose areas.
2.  **Orientation**: Ensure the phone is aligned with the vehicle's direction of travel.
    *   Go to **Settings > Phone Mounting** to calibrate.
    *   **Important**: If mounting vertically (screen facing driver), tilt the device at least 30° back to avoid sensor issues.

### Permissions
CarPilot requires the following permissions:
- **Location**: "Always Allow" or "While Using App" (for high-precision GPS).
- **Motion & Fitness**: For accelerometer and gyroscope data.
- **Microphone** (Optional): For noise level analysis (recorded data is sound level only, no voice).
